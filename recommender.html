                        <h2 class="major">Consilium</h3>
                        <p>
                            Consilium is a movie recommender web application. It starts by asking new users to rate movies they have seen. The data
                            will then be used to determine users' taste and preference for movies. There are two distinct algorithms powering the
                            application and they both belong to the class of collaborative filtering.
                        </p>
                        <h3>So what is collaborative filtering?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Imagine you are shopping for a new pair of shoes. There are many seemingly trendy options to pick from. You are
                            having a hard time to decide which style and which color to go for. How do you resolve a dilemma like this? You'd start
                            asking people for second opinion. You'd ask people who share similar taste and preference with you because chance is,
                            if they like something, you will also like it. Collaborative filtering is a process of grouping similar users together
                            and filter for most liked items within the group, i.e. grouping you with your peers and recommend you products that are most liked
                            by your peers.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="major">k-Nearest Neighbor</h3>
                        <p>
                            The first algorithm we need to talk about is called k-Nearest Neighbor. It's basically consulting the k number of users that are most similar
                            to you in terms of taste and preference for movies. Using those k number of users as input, the algorithm will make a rating prediction on a
                            given movie.
                        </p>
                        <h4>What does "similar" mean?</h4>
                        <p>
                            We can mathematically quantify how similar two users are by looking at their rating patterns on products (in our case, it's movies.)
                        </p>

                        <h3>Mathematical Formulations</h4>
                        <h4>Computing similarity</h4>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                            I<sub>u</sub> is the set of movies that user <strong>u</strong> has rated and I<sub>v</sub> is the set of movies that user <strong>v</strong>
                                has rated. The notation is saying that, iterate through teh set of movies that both users have rated.
                            </p>

                                C is the correlation normalization constant

                            <p id="sim-norm"></p>
                            <p>
                                The similarity function is known as the <strong>Pearson coefficient</strong>
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            Pearson coefficient gives a value between -1 and 1. It indicates strong positive correlation with +1 and strong negative correlation with -1.
                            Once we have a way to quantify similarity, we can then select the <strong>K</strong> most similar neighbors for a given user.
                            Similarity is serving as a statistical weight, it allows us to compute the <i>collaborative</i> opinions of neighbors

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                The rating prediction for user <strong>u</strong> on movie <strong>i</strong> is given by the following expression:
                            </p>
                            <p id="rating-aggregation"></p>

                                The base line rating is the average movie rating of user <strong>u</strong>. For example, if user <strong>u</strong> has rated 3
                                movies e.g. movie A - 5 stars, ,movie B - 5 stars, and movie C - 2 stars, he has an average rating of 4 stars and that is his baseline.
                            </p>
                            <p id="gamma-factor"></p>

                                Gamma is a normalization constant
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            Given a large data set of user ratings on movies, we can easily compute movie rating predictions for new users that are coming to our system.
                            Once we find highly rated movies, we can push them as product recommendations to users. <strong>However</strong>, kNN suffers from scalability
                            problem. The data set we use contains 260,000 users. For every item we wish to recommend, we need to iterate through 260,000 users to find the k
                            most similar users who also have rated the item. Plus, k-Nearest-Neighbor isn't a real machine learning algorithm. It's time to look at the next
                            algorithm.

                        <h4>SVD as in Singular Value Decomposition</h4>
                        <p>
                            Singular value decomposition of a matrix <strong>A</strong> is the factorization of <strong>A</strong> into
                            a product of three matrices A = UDV<sup>T</sup> where the columns of U and V are orthonormal and matrix D is
                            diagonal with positive real numbers. The orthorgonality of the column vectors is a strong property; they form the bases of
                            reconstructing matrix A. However, not all columns contain equal amount of information of the original matrix A. The amount of
                            information each column encodes can be found in the diagonal entries of D matrix. SVD allows us to low rank factorizes
                            a matrix. That means, it allows us to get rid of information of little importance.
